Tradeforce is a webapp designed to connect community members together to facilitate the direct exchange of items in a barter-like system.

By engaging with one another in trade, Tradeforce helps two-fold: strengthening community ties as people come together to help their neighbours; and also reducing collective spending and waste, finding new homes for items that would otherwise be discarded.
