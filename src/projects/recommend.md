rECOmmend is a web application meant to encourage eco-friendly lifestyle changes. It provides consumers with a user-friendly interfact to search for sustainable, environmentally conscious alternatives to products they are interested in using as well as the businesses that sell them. It also incentivizes this switch by offering points that can be redeemed for rewards offered by participating businesses. For businesses, rECOmmend serves as a platform for engaging with environmentally-minded consumers, as the business can easily list and update available products and promotions.

### My Contributions

* implemented basic login system for both consumer and business users
* performed code reviews and design consultations with teammates
